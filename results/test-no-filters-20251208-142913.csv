It is the first and only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center dedicated solely to children. Since its opening, St. Jude has strived to advance cures for children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases through research and treatment. 

As one of the largest pediatric oncology centers in the world, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital has treated children from all 50 states and around the world. Today, St. Jude has one of the world's leading pediatric brain tumor programs, as well as one of the largest bone marrow transplant and sickle cell disease programs in the United States. 

Headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, St. Jude has eight affiliate clinics across the United States. The hospital also shares its breakthroughs with resources like St. Jude Cure4Kids and St. Jude Cloud, which enable doctors and scientists across the globe to access St. Jude findings, helping them save even more lives.

Aligned with Danny Thomas’ vision, St. Jude is committed to ensuring no child is denied treatment based on race, religion, or financial standing. This is largely made possible by the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities® (ALSAC®), the hospital’s awareness and fundraising organization. ALSAC focuses on connecting with donors and spreading awareness about the organization while St. Jude focuses on improving survival rates through innovative, cutting-edge research and technology. Major goals of this research include understanding the molecular, genetic and chemical bases of catastrophic diseases in children, as well as finding new life-saving treatments and methods of prevention for said diseases.

Our cause and passion is to strengthen our communities through youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility. We are one of the largest nonprofit social service organizations in Minnesota and one of the largest Y associations in the United States.  More  than 220,000 members and participants are connected annually throughout the Twin Cities and western Wisconsin region with opportunities to be healthy, active, and engaged.

We support our communities through 27 membership branches, seven resident camps, nearly a dozen day camps, and dozens of child care locations and youth development program sites. The Y nurtures the potential of every youth and teen, improves the community's health and well-being, and provides opportunities to give back and support neighbors. 

The Y is for everyone. We believe that everyone, regardless of age, income or background, has the opportunity to be healthy, welcomed, confident, connected, and secure.",1856,non-profit organizations,,https://s3.ai-ark.com/ark-company/images/1755ded4-069e-3ea0-aa51-4c470ae37b32.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20251208T142912Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Credential=HC2GZVQFT79BXWGX0GP2%2F20251208%2Fai-ark%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=192d2d062de21dd7e6447b94a835fd31f10c034f4adbec54bc4c58d4b045fa47,,"The Y’s mission is to put Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind, and body for all.

The political struggles that preceded this historic event date back over a hundred years.
In 1957, when Ghana achieved full political Independence the constitution was fashioned after the Westminster model. In June, 1960, ten women were elected by the National Assembly to fill specially created seats. This was done to expose women to parliamentary life. This system of election was not intended to be permanent. The Act made no provision for filling a vacancy caused by death, resignation or expulsion of a woman Member.
On 1st July, 1960 Ghana became a sovereign unitary Republic. In February, 1964 Ghana adopted a one-party system of Government. The First National Assembly of the Republic was , dissolved in 1965 and a general election in which all the 198 Members, all of them Members of the national party, the convention People''s Party (C.P.P.) were elected unopposed.The 1964 Constitutional Amendments among other things increased the powers and prerogatives of the President.
In February, 1966 the First Republican Government was overthrown by a military coup which installed a military government that remained in power up to September, 1969, when, on its own volition, it handed over power to another constitutionally elected government, and thereby restored parliamentary rule once again.
After only 22 months in office the second parliamentary democracy also succumbed to another military rule between January 1972 and October 1979, when under much political pressure, that military government was compelled to usher in the Third Republican parliamentary system. In December 1981 parliamentary democracy was once more thrown into cold storage as a result of yet another military coup. However, the country returned to constitutional rule again on 7th January, 1993.",1993,government administration,,https://s3.ai-ark.com/ark-company/images/775c6e1e-dd4a-d7ef-fbe8-fd8079930cac.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20251208T142912Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Credential=HC2GZVQFT79BXWGX0GP2%2F20251208%2Fai-ark%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=8e4c4f428297a34b334093b379e9e9feac75807034df6018d347954b4dc79b06,,,1000,501,1116,GOVERNMENT_AGENCY,"[{""name"": ""AI"", ""category"": ""Other""}, {""name"": ""Apache"", ""category"": ""Load Balancers""}, {""name"": ""Facebook Login (Connect)"", ""category"": ""Social Login""}, {""name"": ""Facebook Widget"", ""category"": ""Widgets""}, {""name"": ""Google Font API"", ""category"": ""Fonts""}, {""name"": ""Google Maps"", ""category"": ""Other""}, {""name"": ""Google Maps (Non Paid Users)"", ""category"": ""Other""}, {""name"": ""Google Play"", ""category"": ""Widgets""}, {""name"": ""Google Plus"", ""category"": ""Social Login""}, {""name"": ""JQuery 1.11.1"", ""category"": ""CSS and JavaScript Libraries""}, {""name"": ""Mobile Friendly"", ""category"": ""Other""}, {""name"": ""Nginx"", ""category"": ""Load Balancers""}, {""name"": ""Remote"", ""category"": ""Other""}, {""name"": ""YouTube"", ""category"": ""Online Video Platforms""}, {""name"": ""Zimbra"", ""category"": ""Email Providers""}]",master_legal,governmental_affairs_regulatory_law,"[{""school"": {""id"": ""5e99941c-2c44-7d2b-66b3-5938dd64a74e"", ""name"": ""University of Ghana"", ""logo"": ""https://s3.ai-ark.com/ark-company/images/5e99941c-2c44-7d2b-66b3-5938dd64a74e.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20251208T142912Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Credential=HC2GZVQFT79BXWGX0GP2%2F20251208%2Fai-ark%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=442a5d38d93aedbf0712ab292248fa4e2c5588362e75449bbc455c6dbf152500"", ""url"": ""https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-ghana-legon""}, ""degree_name"": ""Bachelor of Arts - BA"", ""field_of_study"": ""Philosophy & Sociology"", ""grade"": null, ""date"": {""start"": ""2013-01-01"", ""end"": ""2017-12-31""}}]",US,en,,"[{""country"": ""US"", ""language"": ""en""}]",,,,,,False,False,False,,"[{""company"": {""id"": ""775c6e1e-dd4a-d7ef-fbe8-fd8079930cac"", ""name"": ""Parliament of Ghana"", ""logo"": ""https://s3.ai-ark.com/ark-company/images/775c6e1e-dd4a-d7ef-fbe8-fd8079930cac.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20251208T142912Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Credential=HC2GZVQFT79BXWGX0GP2%2F20251208%2Fai-ark%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=8e4c4f428297a34b334093b379e9e9feac75807034df6018d347954b4dc79b06"", ""url"": ""https://www.linkedin.com/company/parliament-of-ghana"", ""employees"": {""start"": 501, ""end"": 1000}}, ""date"": {""start"": ""2020-01-01"", ""end"": null}, ""profile_positions"": [{""company"": ""Parliament of Ghana"", ""description"": null, ""title"": ""Parliamentary Relations Officer"", ""employment_type"": null, ""location"": null, ""date"": {""start"": ""2020-01-01"", ""end"": null}}]}]",,,,https://s3.ai-ark.com/ark-person/images/0d75512d-15b9-e85d-71de-86bdb724c4b0.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20251208T142912Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Credential=HC2GZVQFT79BXWGX0GP2%2F20251208%2Fai-ark%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=4152bd5323e855908c7fab6416697fd4c34995fc1e9a22150d15f0f2571ffff7,,,
